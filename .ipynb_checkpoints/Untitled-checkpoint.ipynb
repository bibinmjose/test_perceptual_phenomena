    "In a Stroop task, participants are presented with a list of words, with each word displayed in a color of ink. The participant’s task is to say out loud the color of the ink in which the word is printed. The task has two conditions: a congruent words condition, and an incongruent words condition. In the congruent words condition, the words being displayed are color words whose names match the colors in which they are printed: for example  <font color='red'>** RED**</font>, <font color='blue'>**BLUE**</font>. In the incongruent words condition, the words displayed are color words whose names do not match the colors in which they are printed: for example <font color='green'>**PURPLE**</font>, <font color='purple'>**ORANGE**</font>. In each case, we measure the time it takes to name the ink colors in equally-sized lists. Each participant will go through and record a time from each condition\n",

    "Now it’s your chance to try out the Stroop task for yourself. Go to this link, which has a Java-based applet for performing the Stroop task. Record the times that you received on the task (you do not need to submit your times to the site.) Now, download this dataset which contains results from a number of participants in the task. Each row of the dataset contains the performance for one participant, with the first number their results on the congruent task and the second number their performance on the incongruent task.\n",
